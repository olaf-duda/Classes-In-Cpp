# Classes-In-Cpp
A simple example of me creating classes of dishes for an imaginary restaurant. The program itself asks you for how many soups you want and then how many knuckles you would want. The program then prints out how many of each dish was chosen. There aren't a lot of error checking, since this was made some time ago, to learn how to use classes.
